It\u0026rsquo;s a very picturesque town with many pubs and restaurants situated in very traditional architecture.\nThe original series helped me through the various COVID lockdowns. Stuck at home and nothing to do. The style of these illustrations were fairly cartoonish, but I tried to be faithful to the building\u0026rsquo;s layout.\nPocklington Redux 2025 # This year I decided to revisit them, but this time simplifying each building and producing a series of individual portraits of each business around town. Past and present.\nI guess they are a bit of a positive caricature and I\u0026rsquo;ve distilled them down to the elements that make them instantly recognisable. Now that I\u0026rsquo;ve completed about eighteen of them and seem them all together, they kind of feel individual but part of a family. Especially when they have a similar style and occupy the same dimensions.\nExhibition in the offing? # My initial aim is to reach fifty of these individual pieces, possibly extending out to some residential houses that I covet around town.\nMaybe I could make one or two pieces of groups of buildings? They do seem a bit lonely on their own, but this possibly represents their individuality? I am starting to backward engineer my reasoning here :-).\nAnyway, it would be nice to finally find a place for these to display them and maybe actually sell one or two. Pocklington Arts Centre is always a great place to hold exhibitions up stairs in their bar area. I was part of a photography exhibition there a few years ago. I\u0026rsquo;ll need to find a way to cheaply frame fifty works though. Any ideas are welcome.\nI am averaging two to three pieces a week, while I contend with the day job.

Each year I have grandiose ideas of making one intricate masterpiece that involves all the prompts and unveil each aspect of the piece each day and it slowly reveals an outer story. Like my failed attempt from 2021. An illustration along the lines of my Unlikely Stories that are heavily influenced by the great Mattias Adolffsen. I love his art, loads of details that jump out at you, sometimes very subtle, but always with great humour.\nThe Plan # When I started doing Inktober back in 2017 I worked with pen and watercolour which I repeated for 2018. In 2019, I decided to adhere to the spirit of the whole game which was \u0026ldquo;ink\u0026rdquo;, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist adding some colour to the whole thing.\nIn 2020, I went digital and created my images with Adobe Illustrator, and paid more attention to the template with an inky splat as a background. I think that worked really well, but it was a lot of work, scanning my doodles, auto-tracing them and colouring them up.\nIn 2022, I returned to the ink theme and managed to stay black and white. This time using an ink wash, really soaking the picture and letting the textures of the ink bring them alive. I also tried to create a theme of portraiture too, they kind of look like a set of old monochrome photos. Some of them looked a little macabre.\nSo in 2024, I decided to keep with the ink only plan. I\u0026rsquo;ve always kept with the Instagram friendly square format, but the one knew challenge I placed up on myself was to make sure each doodle was done quickly. What went on the paper stayed there and I kept within a 10 minute window to complete each one.\nI kept them really small. The originals are only 2.5cm square and I like the roughness of them once scanned and digital.\nI also used a Fude Fountain Pen which really allows for radical changes in stroke widths and can give a real paint effect to the lines. The Derwent Inktense Paint in Racing Green because the black pan was just too intense for my shading. However, the green gave a nice duotone effect once scanned on my rubbish printer.\n","date":"25 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/content/posts/doodles/inktober-2024/","section":"Contents","summary":"","title":"Inktober 2024","type":"content"},{"content":" Architecture : Likely and Unlikely # I\u0026rsquo;ve turned my interest back to architecture this weekend as I started a new course on Domestika with a brilliant artist called Albert Kiefer who I have followed for quite a while now on Instagram.\nHis free and open style has really inspired me to revisit the illustrations I did for my home town of Pocklington that got me through much of the lockdown periods.\nLikely Architecture # I really liked the style of these and the use of watercolour too. However, I always felt that they were lacking a little depth having no perspective and they seem to be floating on the white paper.\nAlbert is promoting the use of marker pens which I used in art college and during the days when I worked in Advertising. But today the Copic Markers are just so expensive. So I might just stick to my watercolours.\nSo I will have to give it a little time to run through the course and I will try and document my progress here, warts and all. That might be interesting to someone, or at least cathartic for me to air my successes and failures.\nUnlikely Architecture # All this thinking of architecture led me to think about this series that I did some time ago. I think they were a precursor to my Pocklington series and very much in a cartoon style.\nThe Cock Inn # Anyone who knows me, knows that I can\u0026rsquo;t let any kind of double entendre slide by unnoticed and I have passed this gift to my son. I love the name of this pub, and I know for definite that there is one in the northern suburbs of Sheffield. So there are quite possibly a lot of Cock Inn\u0026rsquo;s around the country.\nDuwey, Cheatum \u0026amp; Howe, Lawyers # Keeping the double entendre going in a much more family friendly vein. I think I initially had a whole townful of building like this in mind. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll makes some more in parallel to my more serious architectural sketches.\nNo. 4 \u0026ldquo;SOLD\u0026rdquo; # I remember enjoying this one. It\u0026rsquo;s funny how you get in the swing of things after having done a few. Watercolour for me is a string of happy accidents, but this day the paint seemed to work.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll hopefully have noticed by now that I\u0026rsquo;m using the footprint of each one. The construction is pretty much traced and they are the exact proportions to fit comfortably on A4 paper.\nThis is the first time I drew the cactus, which has become a little trademark in my Unlikely Stories Series\u0026hellip;\nThe Local Fire Station # The \u0026ldquo;Fire Department\u0026rdquo; doors are pretty much taken from the American style. I have travelled the US extensively and distinctly remember a Boston station having these large red wooden doors. In the US, it\u0026rsquo;s customary for each fire station to have a Spotted Dalmation as the department\u0026rsquo;s mascot or pet. I am not sure why\u0026hellip;\nThe Whole Hog # This is possibly one of my favourites. I like the detail of the cuts of meat and dead birds in the window.\nI also started to use the POSCA white line pens to pick out the details here. Once the dark paint goes down, the line work tends to get a little lost.\nI am sure they would be shut down immediately if someone spotted the meat cleaver wobbling on the window above.\nThe Clock Tower # I think this is one of my first attempts at this series due to it\u0026rsquo;s simplicity. I really like the weather wooden boards, like it was once a pristine white clock tower when it was built. It feels quite Scandinavian to me.\nI recently saw a video on Youtube that talked about the use of clock towers on British supermarkets and that most of them don\u0026rsquo;t work. Some architect designed one in Southern England in the 1950\u0026rsquo;s to make them more sympathetic to English towns. The new supermarkets looked very brutalist and very American. It quickly became a template for supermarkets throughout the country, except a working clock was a detail too far.\nI have a totally unnecessary reference to Room 101.\nWee House # Another early version of the Unlikely Architecture series. Most likely the first one I ever did.\nThe watercolour for the wall turned out perfect, and I love the quaint roof tiling.\nThe grandiose archaic door is also like something from a medieval castle with the big bras hinges.\nFeel free to click on the images and make some comments on my Flickr page!\n","date":"14 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/content/posts/unlikley-architecture/architecture-likely-unlikely/","section":"Contents","summary":"","title":"Unlikely Weapons 2022","type":"content"},{"content":"","date":"9 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/blockchain/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Blockchain","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/crypto/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Crypto","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/nft/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"NFT","type":"tags"},{"content":" NFT : An unlikely project # Over the summer I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading about the \u0026ldquo;Blockchain\u0026rdquo; and Crypto-currencies, mostly due to developments with the day job, but it soon brought me to the attention of the bizarre phenomenon of NFTs, or \u0026ldquo;Non Fungible Tokens\u0026rdquo;. This is again thanks to my inquisitive son who just loves to stick his nose in all these technical things.\nWhat is an NFT? # Each NFT is a unique digital asset stored on a blockchain. NFTs can exist in a variety of formats, but most often are images, audio, or video files. What makes them different from any other digital file is that each NFT has specific code that verifies where exactly it is on a blockchain, or who has ownership.\nYou can think of an NFT as a one-of-a-kind trading card. If you create an NFT, you have ownership over it. People can make digital copies of it, just as prints are made of famous paintings. But only you will have the original, unless you decide to eventually sell it.\nNFT Unlikely Guns # I am a pre-internet, pre-personal computer kid. So my childhood consisted of drawing (amongst other things) and one pastime was doodling soldier battles across various landscapes. Guns were prominent in the movies I watched, and it seemed the fashion for the protagonist to have a very special one; Dirty Harry had his 44 Magnum that could \u0026ldquo;blow your head clean off\u0026rdquo;, Rick Deckard had his Pflager-Katsumata Series D 5223 Blaster and Ellen Ripley had her M-41A Pulse Rifle. So naturally one of my favourite things to doodle are guns and it\u0026rsquo;s led to my Unlikely Weapons Series.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s possibly not a time for lauding the gun. I have no idea how guns work and although I\u0026rsquo;m not necessarily anti-gun, I really hope these guns are fucking useless and very unlikely to exist. I created these individually in Procreate on my iPad after an initial sketch in my sketchbook.\nThe NFT Gun will be accompanied with a unique name for the gun and a semi-realistic manufacturer or brand name, along with some sort of outrageous but believable description about the gun that would suggest its unlikelihood of being a real weapon. I used OpenAI to generate this information which somehow seemed fitting with this Crypto project.\nYou can setup additional goodies and prizes for each NFT. So each customer will have the opportunity to receive an actual pencil sketch of their unique weapon. Pencil on A5 Bristol Board.\nNFT Unlikely Knives # The other subject I picked was knives, and with rising knife crime rising in the UK I have struggled a little with using this weapon as the subject matter. But with the doodles being so basic and cartoonish I\u0026rsquo;m hoping they\u0026rsquo;re allure is not for lauding them as weapons (I have picked a lot of cooking implements in the collection) and simply love of the graphic itself.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been posting my knives on my Instagram channel. One each day since October (unless the day job got in the way). I thought I\u0026rsquo;d post the doodle along with some clever ditty about the knife, so I dug out a list of \u0026ldquo;Murphy\u0026rsquo;s Laws and Colloraries\u0026rdquo; that I\u0026rsquo;ve found on the internet decades ago and kept them in my back pocket. Suffice to say I quickly ran out of entries that had any connection to knives and just continued picking them out. It seemed fitting to say something along with the basic doodle. If this turns out to be a book that\u0026rsquo;s attributed to an actual human that wrote or collated them, then I will give credit it where it\u0026rsquo;s due.\nThe NFT Marketplace # So, looking at the various NFTs that are available on OpenSea.io, there is a myriad of different styles. All very rich in detail and some more basic than others. I just don\u0026rsquo;t understand how they command the fees of thousands of dollars. It\u0026rsquo;s truly bonkers. I can only imagine that the asset is merely a vehicle to making money, like the old Baseball Trading Cards.\nA lot of the artists make \u0026ldquo;collections\u0026rdquo; which seem to be a riff on one idea. A monkey with different clothing and accessories, a cute penguin, pixelated punks, etc and they must use some sort of computer program to make the variations which can reach into the thousands, maybe even employing AI? So my initial strategy is to create a set of 100. Manually. In order to do that they have to be very basic and quick.\nBuying Crypto # I\u0026rsquo;ve had such an infuriating time buying crypto. Researching the right soft wallet to store it in. I wanted to make darn sure I could re-instate the thing if I lost my phone or something horrible happened. If you lose access to your wallet, you lose your crypto. So I\u0026rsquo;ve landed on Trust Wallet being the easiest to understand - it\u0026rsquo;s a world that belongs to the geeks.\nThe next hurdle is spending the crypto to create the NFT Collection, then spending on each NFT upload. Each process involves something called a \u0026ldquo;gas fee\u0026rdquo; and it seems to fluctuate wildly for \u0026ldquo;Ethereum\u0026rdquo; the particular currency that NFTs seem to flourish on. Depending on the time of day, it can be quite expensive. When I first tried, uploading one NFT could have cost $2-$8 and for 100 this is not money I have. Some artists must be spending upwards of six figure sums just minting the NFT before they are even sold.\nMy next cheaper option is using another currency called \u0026ldquo;Polygon\u0026rdquo;. There is a smaller NFT market here and it\u0026rsquo;s free to mint (the in-word for creating an NFT on the blockchain) NFTs here, you just have to pay a percentage of the sale price when someone buys one. So this looks to be the best place to dip my toe in.\nBuying crypto on Opensea seems so difficult though. I keep getting errors and glitches and then turned down for the transaction. So I will keep trying until I\u0026rsquo;m successful\u0026hellip;.\n","date":"9 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/content/posts/projects/nft-guns-knives/","section":"Contents","summary":"","title":"NFT : An unlikely project","type":"content"},{"content":"","date":"9 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/procreate/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Procreate","type":"tags"},{"content":" Unlikely Weapons 2022 # I have been drawing guns for years now. Grandiose, fantastical and most likely completely dysfunctional weaponry that looks good.\nI grew up watching movies such as Star Wars, Predator, Alien. All movies with fantastic weaponry depicted in them and somebody somewhere had dreamt them up to look the part, without worrying about how they would actually work in reality. The earliest recollection being Martin Landau\u0026rsquo;s Stun Gun which now looks more like a 2020 paper stapler.\nWhen I share my \u0026ldquo;Unlikely Weapons\u0026rdquo; on Instagram and other social platforms, they seem to draw massive interest from military people and gun enthusiasts, which is great. I don\u0026rsquo;t tend to have problem with responsible gun owners. However, although not deliberate from the beginning, these artworks have developed a dichotomy that I find quite interesting.\nThe weapons are intentionally unlikely to work by design, they just look cool. I know diddly squat about the inner workings of a gun, nor am I ever likely to find out. This knowledge would likely ruin the potential for any new designs, creating boundaries that I would feel couldn\u0026rsquo;t be crossed.\nTo the anti-gun activist, this could represent the best kind of gun on the planet, one that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. But the cool aesthetic of the weapon really appeals to the pro-gun shooter.\nPersonally, I think guns are here to stay. Without wanting to get into the sticky weeds about \u0026ldquo;Concealed Carry\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Self Defence\u0026rdquo;, responsible gun owners should be able to own their guns, whether it be for target shooting, hunting, etc. The Military unfortunately would be a little useless without them. I have never felt the need to own a gun myself, but would love to actually shoot one.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s happening with Unlikely Weapons now?\nSo this year, straight after Inktober 2022, I got to doodling in front of the TV as is my wont. And produced a steady stream of new guns, in a much smaller and free style than I have been used to. This is the first opportunity to try and make these work digitally. So I\u0026rsquo;ll be looking to re-create them on the iPad during November and see what happens.\nGun Collection #1\nI really did try replicating them on the iPad with Procreate. I need to try harder, but I think I spend far too much time working each line. And with pen and watercolour you just have to go with the flow. I have so far made two pieces of unique guns on A3 Bristol Board, both accommodating an A4 space.\nGun Collection #2\nI\u0026rsquo;ve even picked up a couple of guns to focus on as a bigger illustration with a little more detail. Bristol Board on A4.\nWTF-666 Sniper\nI will post more of these later\u0026hellip;.\n","date":"16 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/content/posts/unlikely-weapons/unlikely-weapons-2022/","section":"Contents","summary":"","title":"Unlikely Weapons 2022","type":"content"},{"content":" An especially inky Inktober 2022 # So that\u0026rsquo;s Inktober done for another year. I totally failed last year with an overly ambitious plan, but cracked it this year by being quick and free.\nI also took the decision to avoid colour and only use Platinum Carbon Ink which is permanent for watercolour and also very friendly to fountain pens. For 90% of the posts, I also used a Japanese Brush Pen which I filled with the same ink.\nThe whole month seems to have progressed into a series of portraits, for the most part.\nFor each post I doused the background in clear water first, then added more ink and let it disperse. This proved to be quite a lottery on the finished effect which could really only be controlled by the level of dilution before adding it to the paper.\nThe only downside being that throughout the series you can see a regular pattern where the paper buckled and pooled the ink. Leaving it to dry made the best impression, whereas using a hair dryer seemed to flatten the effect.\nAnyway it was a fun month. I tried to be less literal in the interpretation of the prompts, but that proved difficult for a couple such as \u0026ldquo;Eagle\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Armadillo\u0026rdquo;.\nInktober always rekindles my interest in doodling again, and so I\u0026rsquo;ve got a few more ideas to take forward to Christmas.\n","date":"1 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/content/posts/doodles/inktober-2022/","section":"Contents","summary":"","title":"An especially inky Inktober 2022","type":"content"},{"content":"","date":"1 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/challenge/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Challenge","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/inktober/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Inktober","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pen/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pen","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/adobe/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Adobe","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/album/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Album","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/graphics/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Graphics","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/i-will-take-you-hunting/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"I Will Take You Hunting","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/illustration/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Illustration","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/illustrator/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Illustrator","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/indesign/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Indesign","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/music/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Music","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/print/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Print","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/punk/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Punk","type":"tags"},{"content":" Punk and Procreate # I\u0026rsquo;ve thought long and hard, perused my recent albums to try and think of something that I was really into when working on this. The Summer of 2023, for me, had this brilliant album on constant replay. One of those albums that bury into your brain and leave you with parts of the song ringing in your head at 4am.\nhttps://youtu.be/0MqkFIs33F4\nThis particular project has been incredibly interesting. It re-ignited long forgotten skills of preparing artwork for the traditional printing process that I had in me during the 90\u0026rsquo;s, and also gave me some in-roads to the world of digital art. I bought an iPad Pro several years ago and struggled like mad to become inspired enough to use it.\nI Will Take You Hunting # Two life long friends from my High School days play in this Punk band. In fact, in our teenage years we were connected in bands playing Thrash Metal and Rock which was so much fun. I miss those days incredibly, and I miss my friends Steve and Dave. But we have kept in touch and that makes things so much better.\nhttps://youtu.be/6cvo5wr-H9k?si=EWUct0mY8qhchvyU\nOne of my favourite tracks on the new album... I Will Take You Hunting\u0026rsquo;s (IWTYH) music is better listened to than explained. Steve and Dave are both highly accomplished musicians with very eclectic and varying tastes. Now, things may well have changed since the days when I was with them, but as I remember them with soft-focus-flashback spectacles; Dave was into very heavy Thrash Metal - Obituary, Voivod, Testament and this took him down the path of being probably one of the most talented percussionists in the North East of Scotland, venturing into all sorts of music such as World Music and Tradition Scottish Folk; Steve also had a foot in Thrash Metal with the likes of Testament, Slayer, the \u0026ldquo;Big Four\u0026rdquo;, but he also came from leftfield with Rock influences like Aerosmith and Van Halen, bands that had notable vocalists with unmistakable voices and you can hear those influences in his own unmistakable style.\nDave surprised me when he took to the guitar and bass, but it\u0026rsquo;s really a choice that has made IWTYH somewhat of a surprising experience. The music is stripped down to the basics, deliberately. Making room for their political and social commentary in the lyrics come to the fore. They are both very skilful when it comes to the recording studio, so this new album\u0026rsquo;s production has introduced other aspects that enrich their sound with sampling, keyboards and electronic drum tracks.\nLastly, IWTYH took on a new member, DJ Butterscotch. I haven\u0026rsquo;t had the pleasure of meeting him yet, or hearing the band live (with and without him). The new album \u0026ldquo;Not Broken\u0026rdquo; is further enhanced with his DJ mixing and scratching which is a percussive addition to their sound.\nNot Broken - The concept and the illustrations # In early Summer 2023, they approached me to think of a design for the new album cover. I jumped at the chance, it\u0026rsquo;s a great feeling to be brought into a project like this. However, at the time I had little to go on. Most of the songs had not yet been finalised or even written, so it took some time trying to zero in on what they were after. A few sketches and online discussions.\nIt soon became clear that the album had several themes based on organised religion, global warning and various politics of the day. However, an overarching or recurring theme talks about mental health issues, and is very close to the band\u0026rsquo;s heart who deal with it themselves and the people in their lives.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t fix me, I\u0026rsquo;m not broken I can\u0026rsquo;t fix me I\u0026rsquo;m just different I Will Take You Hunting \u0026ldquo;Not Broken\u0026rdquo;\nSo another great thing about this project, is that I have learned a lot about \u0026ldquo;Neurodiversity\u0026rdquo;. Something which I was completely ignorant of, and I guess most people generally are. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go as far to say that I\u0026rsquo;m an expert in the field, but I am now far more armed to deal with this if I meet someone who - I nearly said \u0026ldquo;suffers from it\u0026rdquo;. And that\u0026rsquo;s the point I think most of us make, I think. \u0026ldquo;Neurodiversity\u0026rdquo; is more of framework to understand mental illness. So for example, someone with Autism may suffer more from societal factors - our inability to treat them as normal - than the actual symptoms of Autism. I think I got that right? It also doesn\u0026rsquo;t come without its own controversy. I thank Steve and Dave for the education.\nI used this new knowledge to create my outer cover illustrations, \u0026ldquo;The Emoto Machines\u0026rdquo; (it was a working title for an as yet untitled album). The machines represent the mechanics of our thoughts. The individual plumbing on how we process everything that hits us day-in / day-out. It\u0026rsquo;s complex and fragile in nature, especially when things might \u0026ldquo;go wrong\u0026rdquo; and the internal or external skills required in troubleshooting the location of that loose wire, or identify how one module can easily upset or overload another connected system downstream.\nAt the end of the process it is our individual wiring that is responsible for being able to convey or create something simplistic and beautiful. Just like any other complex system we have to be mindful of \u0026ldquo;crap in, crap out”, while maintaining kind regard for everyone else’s machines in order integrate and communicate betwen them. That was partly my “day job” talking…\nThe Artwork Process # My process always starts on real paper. During my days at art college, it was always drummed into me that creativity needs to be tactile. This might be way different for the \u0026ldquo;young \u0026lsquo;uns\u0026rdquo; today who can start with an actual tablet which didn\u0026rsquo;t exist in the early 90s.\nOnce I have got to the point where the paper can\u0026rsquo;t handle any more eraser scrubs and I\u0026rsquo;m fairly happy with the layout, I will scan it. There might be some edits in Photoshop - enlarging a character\u0026rsquo;s head or moving some element. Then I\u0026rsquo;ll save it as a PNG and it\u0026rsquo;s ready to import into Procreate.\nI am slowly getting used to the fiddly nuances of Procreate, using layers and swapping from brush to pen. The most fiddly thing was at the end where I had to ensure that the Colour Profile was set to something called \u0026ldquo;Coated FOGRA 39\u0026rdquo; which is apparently what most European print shops using on their presses. This issue only arose after I had imported the artwork into my Adobe Illustrator layouts.\nOnce in Illustrator the rest is quite easy and Scotlands first independent Vinyl production company Seabass Vinyl were incredibly friendly, understanding and helpful for a novice like me. Their upload and patient approval process leaves room for last minute corrections, and they even alerted me to several potential mistakes I made. When I designed the label for the middle of the vinyl disc I hadn\u0026rsquo;t bothered to explicitly label them \u0026ldquo;Side 1\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Side 2\u0026rdquo; - a result of Streaming and listening solely to CDs for the past few decades, it never occurred to me. Luckily, Seabass saved me at the 11th hour and I had the opportunity to correct it.\nConclusion # This was a great project in which I learned a lot. Recovered so much knowledge from my days in Graphic Design during the mid 1990s, and also proved that Procreate is more than capable for producing print quality artwork, that had me so stressed when it was out to print and so relieved when I finally got it in my hands eight months later.\nI am so eager to do another album cover. Band logos are also very interesting to me. Hopefully, the success of this album will necessitate a follow-up for I Will Take You Hunting. I\u0026rsquo;ve had day dreams of doing a picture disc, some type of animated Zoetrope type design. I had this idea in my head for a while and have just been shown an example that Blur has done, even Gorillaz have done one. Turns out it\u0026rsquo;s not such an original idea, but it must be fun to disgn one, they are truly mesmeric.\n","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/content/posts/projects/iwtyh-album-cover/","section":"Contents","summary":"","title":"Punk and Procreate","type":"content"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/seabass-vinyl/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Seabass Vinyl","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/unlikely-machines/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Unlikely Machines","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/automobiles/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Automobiles","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cars/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cars","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/trucks/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Trucks","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/unlikely/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Unlikely","type":"tags"},{"content":" Unlikely : Cars and Trucks # This post was brought to you by Cardiacs brilliant live album Special Garage Concerts Vol I \u0026amp; II.

It\u0026rsquo;ll take a bit of getting used to, but the application is very different to watercolour. Quick drying and extremely intense when it hits the paper so you can really spread a little of it around a large area, but you have to be quick before it drys or stains the paper. You don\u0026rsquo;t have the flexibility you have with watercolour, no second chances to re-moisten and work a little more.\nI finished it off with watercolour and the Derwent Inktense pencils which are fantastic for highights and adding more intense depth to the finished piece.\nI need to throw caution to the wind and get a little more fantastical with these machines, oh and add some humans or some other beings actually driving them.\n","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/content/posts/unlikely-other/cars-and-trucks/","section":"Contents","summary":"","title":"Unlikely : Cars and Trucks","type":"content"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/vehicles/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Vehicles","type":"tags"},{"content":" Doodles: A Circle Squared # Sunday afternoon doodle.

Mattias Adolfsson is an amazing artist who creates these extremely detailed pieces with a fountain pen and watercolour. His work really connected with me and you can probably see his influence in these works.\nAs a child I really enjoyed the Richard Scarry books which had a similar theme of busy and detailed illustrations. He had some books with double page spreads of town scenes, with different animals rushing to work and you could spend a while finding little details. I seem to remember there was always a worm that was difficult to find too. So it\u0026rsquo;s a real joy to find that experience again with Mattias, and something I love to take forward in these unlikely stories.\nFlight from Bondolvia # Flight from Bondolvia was my first attempt to try and develop a story. All good illustrations really need to have an element of story behind them. So I put myself in the frame with Captain Yook and concocted the following:\nTime for a quick cup of Cocoa as Captain Yook takes the controls for the final approach into Stansted. A shopping trip to Bondolvia for some homemade Mescal and 583 oddly shaped “Charlie Bears”. A brisk walk through Nothing to Declare and home\u0026hellip;\nOn reflection, I think I should try and keep things family friendly, but I reckon I\u0026rsquo;m not the first to allude to adult themes that are hopefully well above the heads of the children reading it. I was careful enough to pick an imaginary country (Apologies to the people of Bondolvia if there is one) as I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to insult any existing nation for their out-of-control narcotics trade.\nLiving in the Shadows # For this piece I imagined myself auditioning for The Shadows and how that just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mix with my musical taste which tends toward the Metal and Electronic genres:\nChronology aside, I worked closely with The Shadows in their post-Richard era. However, we quickly decided to part ways on account of artistic differences in their musical direction.\nI struggled with the watercolour on this. I really wanted a flatter blue on the walls, but it just didn\u0026rsquo;t work out. Maybe not enough of a wash. The cactus and teddy bear has also become a repeated motif in these works, usually to fill in the space when I\u0026rsquo;ve run out of ideas.\nCupertino Presentation # Back in the late 90s and into the early 2000\u0026rsquo;s I lived and worked in Chicago for a software company. I remember getting the first version of the iPhone and have had them ever since. I\u0026rsquo;ve also been married to Apple products since 1991! I remember the first versions of MP3 players before the iPod made an appearance, and I also invested heavily in Mini Discs which were thought to be the future of music media.\nBack in 2000 I was invited to Cupertino to present my vision of the future to Steve Jobs. It didn\u0026rsquo;t amount to anything, other than some mediocre \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; phones somehow becoming fashion of the day.\nSo I filled this scene with all the clunky electronics that were around (and not around) in that era, and here I am presenting some smart phone that incorporated the Mini Disc technology. I love how Steve Jobs seems to be seriously considering my proposal before calling for Security, I\u0026rsquo;m sure I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have gotten through the front door.\nAgility on Line #1 # The rest of these have been presents for friends and colleagues leaving my place of work. So the details tend to be little in-jokes or things that mean something to the person receiving it. They were also poignant to other colleagues who had worked with them for a number of years. Ted was a great colleague and friend and I was especially sad to see him move on to greener pastures.\nThe Music Room # This was a paid commission! Very grateful to have received payment for doing this for a friend. Her husband Bruce is a huge music fan, so I decided to place him in his music room and festoon the place with clues about bands and other little knick-knacks that mean a great deal to him.\nMartin\u0026rsquo;s Retiring # I worked with Martin for a good couple of decades and consider him a good friend. He is the most patient person I have met, so great with customers and had a real talent for keeping everyone calm and working through a problem. I wish I could be more like him, and now that he\u0026rsquo;s gone I do find myself thinking \u0026ldquo;How would Martin handle this?\u0026rdquo;.\nAgain, there are loads of details in here that would go straight over the head of anyone who hadn\u0026rsquo;t worked with him, but I enjoyed making it for him.\nThe Unexpected Guest # A birthday present for Angelika who turned 50. She and her husband Chris are massive KISS fans as well as loving various 1980\u0026rsquo;s hair rock bands. Angelika is German, hence all the references such as England beating them on TV with a very appropriate score.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t done one of these forever and need to get my head back into them.

A pastel crayon for the shading and a rough pencil for line-work, both giving more obvious papery impressions.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve taken the originals in most cases and traced over the top of them, so they are quite similar but the colours seem more vivid and the ability to provide a striking background colour really makes them pop.\nNFT Musings # I was hoping these would be suitable for minting as NFTs, and I still might get round to that. However, I have since learned a little more about methods of creating more appealing and collectible NFTs. The obvious barrier to these being they don\u0026rsquo;t easily fit in the square format that is also loved by Instagram. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to do some more research and look into artwork that\u0026rsquo;s been sold on the blockchain that doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit the square format. Anyway, it\u0026rsquo;s food for thought and I still haven\u0026rsquo;t got to fully understand the whole Cypto/NFT scene, it looks like it could still be a bit costly up-front.\nIf you look at opensea.io, almost the enire market seems geared toward these collections, almost like Baseball Trading Cards. You can of course sell anything as an NFT, but I don\u0026rsquo;t yet have the gravitas of being a named or renowned artist.\nAnyway, enough for now, hope you enjoy them.

So I built another one\u0026hellip;. It\u0026rsquo;s a real shame because there were some very kind and helpful comments attached which have been lost forever, but I think I still have them in email somewhere. Maybe I can publish them as a follow-up blog at some point. Anyway, here is the original posting back in its entirety.\nThe Painting # This whole thing started with this picture, Nina Miller Davidson\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Lion and the Lamb\u0026rdquo;, that has hung in my family’s house since I was a very young kid. I can’t say I paid any attention to it, it’s been part of the wallpaper. About 15 years ago my Dad gave me the picture and so it hangs in my house and I’ve since started to wonder who the artist, Nina Miller Davidson, really is.\nMy Dad died in 2017, and now I wish I’d written the details down. As much as I know it was gifted to his mother Elma (“Elsa Margaret Pate”, maiden name Smith) by Nina who were good friends. I don’t know if this meant they were life long friends, but they certainly were in the latter part of their lives as they lived close to each other in Eaglesham, on the outskirts of Glasgow.\nThe painting obviously has religious overtones with the Lion and the Lamb, and this is no surprise given her obvious choice of creating church stained glass windows as her preferred medium. However, I think it’s also a reference to the adage “In like a Lion, out like a Lamb” where in the 19th century it was used as a prediction contingent on a year\u0026rsquo;s early March weather: If March comes in like a lion, it will go out like a lamb.\nLastly, I believe this painting was commissioned by a notable Scottish magazine for a front cover. Something along the lines of Country Life (This is what I wish I’d written down from Dad). There is also a rather cryptic inscription on the back made to my Dad, “To Douglas with deepest sympathy from herself”. Even my Dad was perplexed about the message. I’d hazard a guess it might have been a condolence around the time his mother died in 1971 - a guess. The self reference to “herself” hints at a wry sense of humour that makes me like her a lot.\nAbout Nina # Nina Miller Davidson was born in 1895. And seems to have reportedly died in 1957 which I have yet to confirm. My Mum met her long after that date since she was dating my Dad at the time and in 1957 my Mum would have been 12.\nI think she studied and possibly taught at the Glasgow School of Art, and apparently studied in Paris and Italy too. Her next door neighbour in Eaglesham was Kathleen Whyte, a fine embroider and also a lecturer there. Nina was married (briefly it seems) to Charles Lamb Davidson (b. 4th July 1897- d. 23rd Jan 1948), also a painter, stained glass designer, interior designer and cartoonist in his own right, attending The Glasgow School of Art from 1914 to 1917.\nThe son of a monumental sculptor with the same name, he was born in Brechin, Angus Scotland. After serving as a Captain in the Seaforth Highlanders during the First World War, he returned to Scotland and worked as cartoonist for the Glasgow Evening Times while still exhibiting his paintings at the Glasgow Institute and the Royal Scottish Academy.\nI have since read that in 1926 he married an art teacher called Janet Frame Miller from Hamilton and died twenty five years later in Thorntonhill, East Kilbride of cardiac failure. Did he divorce from Nina? When was he married to Nina? A little more research required possibly.\nShe was instrumental in the restoration of the village of Eaglesham in the 1950\u0026rsquo;s which led to the village becoming recognised as the first place in the country to receive conservation status. Nina lived in the village\u0026rsquo;s Montgomery Street. She bought the Old Ham Store (No. 54) in 1950 and applied for planning permission to turn it into a dwelling house. It took 18 months for permission to be granted. Today, one of the bridges on the Orry (the village green) is dedicated to her.\nNina\u0026rsquo;s Artwork # Ann of Ingleside Book Cover Design Nina, and her artwork, is really hard to track down. I’m thinking this is going to be the first of few blogs to highlight the work that she has done. Other than my “Lamb and the Lion”, there are just a handful of set pieces I can find, which I think I will post separately once I’ve gathered more information about them. She also seemed to have some success with designing numerous book cover jackets like the “Anne of Ingleside” this example.\nThe most obvious painting that turns up after a simple Google search is this very art nouveau painting of young women making some sort of offering. Thanks to Hillhouse Antiques for the image, I would love to see this in real life. Approx 21.5\u0026quot; by 13.5\u0026quot; inc frame. Visible w/c area approx 14.5\u0026quot; by 6.75\u0026quot;.\nNina\u0026rsquo;s Stained Glass Windows # Nina’s artistic career excelled in the creation of stained glass windows in several churches around Scotland. Again, this may be a voyage of discovery as I have since found another church to add to my list. In August 2019, I took a trip with the family to Edinburgh and Glasgow having identified a handful of churches that reportedly had her windows installed. I’ll warn you now, I had limited success but I will list them here in order of our trip.\nSt Peter\u0026rsquo;s Church, Morningside - 77 Falcon Avenue, Edinburgh, EH10 4AN # St Peter's Church, Morningside We visited Edinburgh in gorgeous summer heat to attend the last evening of the Tattoo. On Saturday 24 August, 2019 morning we paid a visit to St Peter’s having read that the towering nave in white-washed brick is lit by six tall windows. Stained glass by Morris and Gertrude A Meredith Williams, Nina Millar Davidson, and Pierre Fourmaintraux.\nHowever, we need to return to this church as we arrived in the middle of “Confession” and right before “Communion” and there were worshippers present that really didn’t need a photographer banging around taking pictures. I’m really not sure which windows were hers. We will return.\nFormer Pollockshields West Church - 620 Shields Road, Glasgow, G41 2RD # Former Pollockshields West Church On Monday 26 August, 2019 having had a lovely Sunday out in central Glasgow we drove out to the Pollockshields area, just south of the River Clyde. According to a now defunct Pollockshields’ History site, Nina had installed a stained glass window in the West Church - “The interior was re-modelled in 1923 and then included stained glass by both Alf Webster, one of Scotland’s finest stained glass artists who died tragically young in the First World War, and Nina Millar Davidson.”\nSince then, the building has been converted to a nursing home. Formerly “Nithsdale Lodge Nursing Home”, later “Rowandale Nursing Home” has since closed during the pandemic. I knocked on the front door and the asked the receptionist if he knew of the artwork I was after. Unfortunately, it seems that all the stained glass from the entire church has been replaced with clear glass as part of the renovation. I’m really hoping that the windows were saved and not discarded into a skip. I think I need to try and find this out. Even if a private individual has purchased them, or if someone has a photograph of them in situ, it would be great to capture what these windows looked like.\nMerrylea Parish Church - 78 Merrylee Road, Glasgow G43 2QZ # Merrylea Parish Church It was a short drive from Pollockshields to Merrylee, near Muirend. Merrylea Church was closed on arrival. Their own website describes Nina’s window as being “[that little window] based on the famous painting \u0026ldquo;The Light of the World\u0026rdquo; by Holman Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_of_the_World_(painting)) and depicts Jesus knocking at the door. He is, as is Merrylea, standing on the mound and His “I am the Way” surmounts the picture.” We walked round the grounds, peering at the windows from the outside trying to ascertain which window it could be, but none seemed to match a figure knocking at a door. We knocked on the caretaker’s door and man answered. Obviously in the middle of decorating, the smell of gloss paint everywhere, he kindly let us into the church to walk around and view all the stained glass that instantly lit up from the darkened indoors. Beautiful windows, that have really ignited an interest in these works of art in general. We did not find Nina’s Light of the World though. Although there was one odd window in the whole church that was clear glass. Was this her window that my have been damaged beyond repair and replaced with a plain window? I will send a letter to the church and see if they can shed some light (on the world)…\nST. JOACHIM’S RC - 102 Inzievar Terrace, Carmyle, Glasgow G32 8JT # We hit the jackpot on visiting St. Joachims. It’s a fairly modern church nestled in the back of a housing estate in the south east of Glasgow. We buzzed on the gates and Francesca let us into the church. A very helpful woman, she let me through to take pictures of the two windows at the end of the chapel, just above a shallow choir stage that is no longer used. There two windows, one representing St. Joachim and the other St. Anne. Both depict an angel announcing the birth to come. St. Joachim’s window also shows his expulsion from the Temple while St. Anne’s includes a representation of her and her daughter Mary.\nThis was my first sighting of Nina’s window art. They are a lot more traditional than I had imagined, but I can see a connection in the lines of the artwork with my own “Lion and Lamb”. I took a few pictures and then spent a minute to try and commit them to memory. Very grateful to St. Joachim’s Church for letting me in to take pictures, we had a brief chat with Francesca before leaving to have a walk around Eaglesham.\nEaglesham, Glasgow # In the late forties, Nina Davidson and Kathleen Whyte campaigned to restore the 18th century village. By the fifties, a world-wide appeal was launched for funds towards Eaglesham’s conservation. The former weavers\u0026rsquo; cottage in Montgomery Street was the first house to be restored in the village. It was bequeathed to the National Trust for Scotland by Nina.\nOur trip on the Monday afternoon was a bit of a let down. The town is beautiful and so is the local tea shop. However, the church was locked and the local library was closed all day. A little more research and preparation on my part for our next visit is required. Ahem…\nNext on the list… # I have since found two more churches that have windows of Nina’s. So, another trip to Scotland beckons:\nOur Lady of Loretto, Musselburgh - 17 Newbigging, Musselburgh EH21 7AJ # There is a window depicting The Baptism of Christ . I will have to include this on our return to St. Peters in Morningside.\nBrodick Parish Church, Brodick - 2 Cora Linn Ct, Brodick, Isle of Arran KA27 8A # Apparently, in 1961 Nina has installed two of her windows at St. Brides Church, based on original sketches made by Douglas Hamilton. This might be part of a wider expedition later on.\nThe plot thickens\u0026hellip; # There are several nagging questions that I need to find out now:\nNina’s birth and death dates. Many sites state that she died in 1957, but I think this is incorrect. The spelling of her name “Miller”. There is some evidence that she was actually a “Millar”, and a walk round Eaglesham church shows a couple of headstones with this surname. I am assuming she was local to Eaglesham throughout her life? However, my “Lion and Lamb” is signed by “herself” as “Nina Miller Davidson”. I’d also like to know more about her marriage to Charles. It seems that he married in 1926 to Janet Frame Miller, so one of his marriages didn’t last long presumably. This \u0026lsquo;aint the last I will write on Nina\u0026hellip;.\n","date":"22 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/content/posts/projects/nina-miller-davidson-update-1/","section":"Contents","summary":"","title":"Nina Miller Davidson","type":"content"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/nina-miller-davidson/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Nina Miller Davidson","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/scotland/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Scotland","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/scottish/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Scottish","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/stained-glass/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Stained Glass","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/windows/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Windows","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/topics/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Topics","type":"topics"}]
