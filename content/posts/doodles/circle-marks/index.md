# Doodles : Circle Marks

On one of several work calls this week, doodling and definitely paying attention. Doodling has always helped me concentrate on the conversations, even though it may not look like it. One of my doodling pursuits is to attain the perfect free-hand circle. This should be in my sketchbook, but it's not always at hand. I also get a mental block with my sketchbook sometimes. It's like I'm scared to make a mark on the page and end up with a less than pristine journal of creative endevours. It's stupid I know.

Another idea for another day. Next time using some different types of pens and covering far more space than this one inch square.
