# Doodle : AI Killer Robot

This post is brought to you by this killer album [Gong - Live at the Gong Family Unconventional Gathering](https://gong2032.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-the-gong-family-unconventional-gathering?from=search&search_item_id=1397981059&search_item_type=b&search_match_part=%3F&asearch_page_id=3372821443&search_page_no=1&search_rank=2&search_sig=0680852e25c3e3392ca74b981051671f), release in 2021 and contains all the hits I love from their extensive discography. I really love the current line-up with Kavus Torabi at the helm.

I got asked today at work what a good User Interface Icon might be to represent AI or Artificial Intelligence. The suggestion was a Magic Wand.

I thought a wee icon of a human brain might be more applicable but it's got to work at a really small scale on a UI button.
I doodled this initial thought within a minute. I'd love an Evil Killer Robot icon, but that might not be appropriate in today's Corporate World. Anyway our software is firmly rooted in Actual Intelligence, which is much better. At the momentâ€¦.

I like the immediacy and roughness of this image, particularly the pixelated pencil sketch above. <br>This actually might be a good idea for my summer T-Shirt screen printing project. I might even working a rough title - KILLER ROBOT, ANGRY ROBOT, BAD ROBOT.....
