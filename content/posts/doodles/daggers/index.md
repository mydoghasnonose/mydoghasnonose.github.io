# Doodles : Daggers

Back from far too long away. I will keep these posts short and sweet. This is a recurring doodle of some daggers I like to draw absent mindedly.

Knives and guns are a favourite of mine and I will dig through my archives and re-post a lot of these artworks from the few years I've been ignoring my blog site.

My doodle posts are really ideas from my sketchbook. They might turn into anything, and more often they will fizzle out. But I intend to post pretty much anything I like in this category.

These seem like medieval daggers or fat swords. I am sure someone will have a correct name for them. I might make some more and see if it makes a nice selection on A4.

I've been working recently with Procreate on the iPad, so I might progress them there and see if a bit of colour brings some more inspiration.
