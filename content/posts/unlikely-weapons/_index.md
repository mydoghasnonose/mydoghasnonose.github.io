## What it's about?

I am a pre-internet, pre-smart phone Generation X-er! So my childhood consisted of real-life pursuits like drawing and doodling soldiers and battles across various landscapes, which soon progressed to drawing guns of various types and I returned to this in my 50s with my Unlikely Weapons Series using ink and watercolour.

We are possibly not living in a time for lauding the gun, but I have no idea how guns work and although I'm not necessarily anti-gun, I am sure these guns are guaranteed to be useless and very unlikely to exist. However, guns were prominent in the movies I watched, and it seemed the fashion for the protagonist to have a very special one; Dirty Harry had his 44 Magnum that could "blow your head clean off", Rick Deckard had his Pflager-Katsumata Series D 5223 Blaster and Ellen Ripley had her M-41A Pulse Rifle.

This is a collection of 100 unique guns created in Procreate on iPad by hand with Actual Intelligenceâ„¢. Never to be repeated or extended anywhere.
