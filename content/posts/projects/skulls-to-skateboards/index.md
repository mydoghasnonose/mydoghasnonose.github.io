# Skulls to Skateboards

So here's one of my potential failures, the details of which I will fully explain in a later blog next week. Today we are all off to Leicester to see my favourite "band" The Orb Live. I have followed them since the mid 90s and its the perfect backdrop to getting in the zone with my art. At the moment I am hooked on this live album I stumbled across on Apple Music, [Further Adventures Beyond Dark Matter](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfUAnz6AAXuVnQ-dScxUsTs0chUrLJBwB&si=Yb7UsJNIzIejYXSN) Live in Brixton in 2014. The first five tracks are amazing.
Anyway, late 2023 I doodle this skull and cross bones in my sketchbook. It's another favourite icon of mine.

Then I vectorised it in Adobe Illustrator which really gave it another life. I have a few versions of this over the years and this is my best so far I think. I particularly like the shadowing, it makes it pop a little better.

Then earlier this year I was thinking that it should really have a better context and it's been in the back of my mind to design a skateboard graphic. So I got busy and mocked up a design on paper that looks good. And then started to think of a way in which I could apply it to a blank board. This is where I will leave it until next week, as there are a few mistakes I have made which possibly means I will make a second attempt...
