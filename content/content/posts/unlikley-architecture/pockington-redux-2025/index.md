### Pocklington Illustrated

Back in 2018 I started drawing various buildings from my hometown of Pocklington. It's a very picturesque town with many pubs and restaurants situated in very traditional architecture.

The original series helped me through the various COVID lockdowns. Stuck at home and nothing to do. The style of these illustrations were fairly cartoonish, but I tried to be faithful to the building's layout.

### Pocklington Redux 2025

This year I decided to [revisit them](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjCdYUq), but this time simplifying each building and producing a series of individual portraits of each business around town. Past and present.

I guess they are a bit of a positive caricature and I've distilled them down to the elements that make them instantly recognisable. Now that I've completed about eighteen of them and seem them all together, they kind of feel individual but part of a family. Especially when they have a similar style and occupy the same dimensions.

### Exhibition in the offing?

My initial aim is to reach fifty of these individual pieces, possibly extending out to some residential houses that I covet around town.

Maybe I could make one or two pieces of groups of buildings? They do seem a bit lonely on their own, but this possibly represents their individuality? I am starting to backward engineer my reasoning here :-).

Anyway, it would be nice to finally find a place for these to display them and maybe actually sell one or two. [Pocklington Arts Centre](https://pocklingtonartscentre.co.uk/) is always a great place to hold exhibitions up stairs in their bar area. I was part of a photography exhibition there a few years ago. I'll need to find a way to cheaply frame fifty works though. Any ideas are welcome.

I am averaging two to three pieces a week, while I contend with the day job. So maybe in late summer or autumn I could do something about that. I have a couple of places that have long gone up my sleeve, some places that residents might have a soft spot for. Here's a couple more to peruse...
