# Unlikely : Cars and Trucks

This post was brought to you by Cardiacs brilliant live album [Special Garage Concerts Vol I & II](https://alphabet-business-concern.bandcamp.com/album/special-garage-concerts-vol-i-ii). I don't know the details of the recordings but it's later in their career and the closest album to this brilliant track on Youtube that I love to listen to time and again.

### The Sketch

I spent a rainy afternoon in front of the TV doodling these automobiles in the sketchbook. This is a careful compliation of them in Photoshop, I like to try and organise them into a Social Media friendly square.

This is very much the first in the series, I intend to make them far more "unlikely" than these. I started stretching the realism with my "X1 Fireball". I should also involve the human element and actually include some drivers, that makes the whole thing a little more endearing I think.

### The Artwork

I inked this on my new lightpad. They've come on leaps and bounds since my first one. This time I've opted for a smaller A4 unit that is wireless. My last one's weak point was the micro-usb power cable, it was the first thing to fail - but I did get a good 3-4 years usage from it.

The colour was first applied with a Christmas present, [Derwent Inktense Paint](https://www.craftyarts.co.uk/inktense-paint-12-pan-palette-set-2-p16447/s30791). It'll take a bit of getting used to, but the application is very different to watercolour. Quick drying and extremely intense when it hits the paper so you can really spread a little of it around a large area, but you have to be quick before it drys or stains the paper. You don't have the flexibility you have with watercolour, no second chances to re-moisten and work a little more.

I finished it off with watercolour and the [Derwent Inktense pencils](https://amzn.eu/d/ayG28HL) which are fantastic for highights and adding more intense depth to the finished piece.

I need to throw caution to the wind and get a little more fantastical with these machines, oh and add some humans or some other beings actually driving them.
