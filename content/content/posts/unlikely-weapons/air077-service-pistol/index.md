Guns are back in the sketchbook this week. They are just an irresistible doodle for me and I loaded these two during a family week off at home in front of the TV while listening to Four Tet's new album called "Three". Not available on Youtube, but here's a really good [Live DJ session](https://youtu.be/hvO0PrMBH9I?si=PXrTs3vEai5eYkmE) from them.

These are the sketches directly from my sketchbook and I might try to render them on my iPad this time using Procreate. I had some success with Procreate when I designed the album cover for Scottish Punk Band [I Will Take You Hunting](https://iwilltakeyouhunting.bandcamp.com/). The album is called Not Broken and is available on Vinyl and CD. I had so much fun doing that and it stretched my memory of designing for print again, which is not something I've done since the mid-90s. Anyway, that is a whole other new blog in its own right.

Anyway, I will keep on drawing guns, despite their extremely negative aspects. I am hoping they are all incredibly unlikely to work. I know absolutely nothing about how they work and I don't really want to. Although I would love a day out shooting them, that would be brilliant.

Here's a collection of guns from my archives, just for the hell of it and to remind you that I have a portfolio of work to peruse.
