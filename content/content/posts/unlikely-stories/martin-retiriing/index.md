# Martin's Retiring

This is latest of a series of illustrations that started from an online course on Domestika with Mattias Adolfsson. I love the small details in his artwork, you spend ages finding little things that surprise you or puzzle you.
This piece was made for a colleague and friend, so the details are all in-jokes, so I need to create some more generic works that might mean more to more people. Iâ€™ll share some previous works too in the coming days.
Watercolor and Ink on Bristol Board A4.
