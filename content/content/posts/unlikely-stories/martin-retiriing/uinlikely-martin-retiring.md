This is latest of a series of illustrations that started from an online course on Domestika with Mattias Adolfsson. I love the small details in his artwork, you spend ages finding little things that surprise you or puzzle you.
This piece was made for a colleague and friend, so the details are all in-jokes, so I need to create some more generic works that might mean more to more people. I’ll share some previous works too in the coming days.
Watercolor and Ink on Bristol Board A4.
