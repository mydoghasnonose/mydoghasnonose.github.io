# Doodles: A Circle Squared

Sunday afternoon doodle. Building on the pencil sketch from my last blog entry. I need magnifier spectacles now, which is a really horrible admission. This time I was more strategic in my placement of the big circles and worked around them. Composition seems better.

I also had a nightmare trying to re-point this blog to my main mydoghasnono.se domain. I totally messed up the whole site, but a couple of backup restores seemed to bring me back to normal. Then I read the manual, so things might go a little better next time.
