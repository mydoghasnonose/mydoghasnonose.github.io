In late 2023 I attended a Silversmith Workshop with [Tori Foster](https://www.torifosterjewellery.com) and hosted at the fantastic workshop owned by [Helen Drye](https://www.silver-stonejewellery.co.uk/). They both have regular sessions available that are really affordable and they make it so much fun too It was a real eye opener and Tori is such a great and talented teacher. So I now have all the Silversmith Gear and No Idea. But I’m starting basic and have almost perfected the art of simple silver rings.

There are some fundamentals I have to practice before I can really start showing what I’ve made properly, such as soldering, cutting, polishing, stone settings, etc. There is also a whole other learning curve on taking the close-up photos of the finished pieces I have to get through too.

That said, in the two-day workshop I made two simple rings, a bracelet/bangle and a pendant with a moonstone setting.

Hopefully this year I’ll be able to make something fairly unique and share it with you. Then I’ll have another little project to set up an Etsy Store. Fingers crossed…
